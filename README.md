# Discord.js Snippets
This repository's purpose is to provide users, both new and veterans alike, of the [Discord.js](http://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js) library
with a bunch of interesting/useful, not always easy-to-think-of, snippets of code.  

It is not meant to be an archive of code that you can just copy-paste into your own.  
In more than 95% of cases you will probably have to adapt the code on your own.

You are more than welcome to submit your own snippets of code by making a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).  
I will try to modify the code to conform to the repository's linter, and also modify it to make use of ES6/2017 features.  
Along with that I will try to improve the code's readability, but I will not make an attempt to try to guide people on how to use it in their own projects.
